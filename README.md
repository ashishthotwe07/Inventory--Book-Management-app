# Inventory App - Book Management

## Introduction
The Inventory App - Book Management is a project that I developed to learn and practice key concepts in web development, including the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture using Express.js and EJS. This application serves as a basic inventory management system for books, allowing users to add, update, and delete book records.

## Key Features
- MVC structure implemented with Express.js and EJS templates.
- User-friendly web interface for managing book inventory.
- Ability to add, update, and delete book records.
- Data is stored temporarily in an object
- Basic validation and error handling.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for views

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. run the server

## Project Structure
- `/public`: Contains static assets (CSS, images, client-side JavaScript).
- `/views`: EJS templates for rendering the views.
- `/controllers`: Contains the route handlers and controller logic.
- `/models`: Defines data models and interactions with the database.


## Learning Objectives
- Implement a basic Express.js web application.
- Design and organize an application using the MVC pattern.
- Utilize EJS for dynamic HTML rendering.
- Create and manage  for storing inventory data.
- Handle form submissions, validation
